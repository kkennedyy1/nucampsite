<p>Inside the HTML section of this Codepen is the code for a Bootstrap container with three rows, each currently containing three columns of equal width. This Bootstrap container is visible above.<p>
  
<p>There is a CSS style applied so that you can see the outline of each column in green, just as a visual aid. The size of your current viewport is also displayed, so that you can easily see when you are hitting certain breakpoints. To change the viewport size, you can resize the width of the Result section/resize your browser. (It is not recommended to use the browser developer tools to change the viewport for this challenge; it will not work well with the Codepen display.)</p>

<p>Hint: The Codepen linked <a href="https://codepen.io/minae/pen/BaaNEmP?editors=1000" target="_blank">here</a> contains a small demo that can help you with this challenge.</p>

<h3>Your Challenge:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you are logged into your Codepen account, or create a Codepen account if you have not already. Use the "Fork" button in the lower right of your screen to create a copy of this code for your own use. Do not edit the original Codepen, as you will not be able to save your edits.</li>
  <li>Edit the classes for the columns in the first row so that when the viewport is SM and up (576px or higher), the columns with the words "One" and "Two" inside them each span across two (of the 12 possible) columns for their row and the "Three" column spans across the remaining columns for the same row. For viewports below size SM, the three columns should remain of equal width.</li>  
  <li>Edit the classes for the columns in the second row so that when the viewport is size MD and up (768px or higher) the column with the word 'Five' inside it spans across 50% of its row (i.e. spans 6 columns), and the columns for 'Four' and 'Six' span across the remaining columns equally (so they both take up 25% each). For viewports that are below size MD, the three columns should remain of equal width. </li>
  <li>Edit the classes for the columns in the third row so that when the viewport is size LG and up (992 px and higher), the columns remain at equal width as they are now, but for sizes below LG, the columns stack on top of each other.</li>
<li>Submit the URL of your forked version of this Codepen as your answer to this Code Challenge in the Nucamp learning portal. </li>
</ol>
<p>You will only need to change code in the HTML section to complete this challenge, not the CSS or JS sections.</p>
<p>You will not be graded on this challenge. It will be used for class discussion and knowledge assessment. Please submit your attempt before your Saturday workshop, even if it's not working completely.</p>
